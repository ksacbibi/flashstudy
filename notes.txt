TODO
- display word on front of card once it gets added
then when user clicks it will flip to back with definition
(i guess for now this can be a simple show/hide)
-- need to store word and definition with id in localstorage, maybe eventually database
-- how should id be set? should it be the placement number in the number of cards or a hash key
